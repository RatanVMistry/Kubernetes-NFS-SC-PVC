SSH to the plain CentOS machine
>> yum install nfs-utils -y
>> systemctl enable rpcbind
>> systemctl enable nfs-server
>> systemctl enable nfs-lock
>> systemctl enable nfs-idmap
>> systemctl start rpcbind
>> systemctl start nfs-server
>> systemctl start nfs-lock
>> systemctl start nfs-idmap
>> mkdir -p /data/nfs/kubernetes
>> chmod -R 777 /data/nfs/

>> vi /etc/exports
/data/nfs/kubernetes	*(rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check,insecure)

(Main thing to point here is you can provide the ip address or the CIDR at the place of (*) and make sure for now you put the same rules here for example you can change that rules per your requirement)

>> exportfs -rav
>> exportfs -v
>> showmount -e
